# VentureStarter: Launch Faster, Document Better

## The Problem: The Documentation Bottleneck

You have a brilliant idea. You've secured the domain. You're ready to build.

**Then comes the documentation...**

- README files that need writing
- Sales materials that need drafting
- Architecture docs that need planning
- Progress tracking that needs setting up

For solo founders and small teams, this initial documentation can consume days of valuable time - time better spent building your product or talking to customers.

## The Solution: VentureStarter

VentureStarter is a simple, zero-install tool that leverages Claude AI to generate all your essential GitHub documentation in minutes, not days.

### How It Works:

1. Copy our proven prompt template
