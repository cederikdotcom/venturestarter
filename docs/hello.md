# Hello, I'm Cederik

## I help founders (especially first-time) go from 0 to $300k ARR without the technical co-founder problem.

Most great ideas die because non-technical founders can't find the right technical partner. I solve this by becoming your technical co-founder with a proven path to revenue.

### Here's how it works:

**The Deal:**
- I start with 80% equity to ensure execution control
- You earn back to 75% by hitting performance milestones  
- I invest $5-25k of my own capital upfront
- Target: $10k MRR in 24 months

**My Role:**
- Technical Co-Founder (preferred) or Managing Director
- Build your MVP and technical foundation
- Scale operations until you have 2-3 FTE team
- Stay involved until $300-400k revenue (self-sufficient)

**Why 80/20 Structure:**
I've learned from 12+ months of cap table drama in 50/50 partnerships. When one founder can't execute, everyone loses. This structure protects both of us and ensures the business succeeds.

**What You Get:**
- Experienced technical co-founder from day one
- Capital investment in your vision
- Systematic approach via my NIMS Forest platform
- Clear path to majority ownership (75%)
- Protection from partnership dysfunction

**What I Get:**
- 25% of a proven $300k+ ARR business
- The satisfaction of turning ideas into successful companies
