3. **Documentation scope**: Keeping the tool focused on initial setup only

### Key Learnings
1. **Simplicity wins**: The zero-installation approach removes significant adoption friction
2. **Documentation patterns**: Common patterns emerged across different project types
3. **AI capabilities**: Claude is well-suited for structured document generation tasks
4. **User feedback**: Initial testers valued time saved over extensive customization options
